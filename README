               Genode support for Allwinner-based boards
               =========================================


This repository complements the Genode OS framework (https://genode.org) with
the board support needed to use Genode on devices based on Allwinner SoCs.

To use it, you first need to obtain a clone of Genode:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git genode

Now, clone the _genode-allwinner.git_ repository to _genode/repos/allwinner_:

! git clone https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner.git genode/repos/allwinner

For enabling the board support, adjust the build-directory configuration
_etc/build.conf_ by adding the following line before the other 'REPOSITORIES'
definitions so that the _allwinner_ repository is prioritized over the others.

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/allwinner
